# StremingService-Clone

This exercise I found on the Youtube channel freeCodeCamp.org (youtube.com/watch?v=KCgYDCKqato&t=15447s)

The app was built programmatically in a few hours with the help of SDWebImage (github.com/SDWebImage) for the fetching and assigning of poster pictures.
Other resources included TMDB Api for the movies/tv shows data and Goggle for the netflixLogo.png in the leftBarButtonItem of the homeTab. 
CoreData was also included in the project to populate the downloadTab with the titles saved on disk.
